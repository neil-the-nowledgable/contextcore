term:
  id: wayfinder
  name: Wayfinder
  type: implementation
  version: "1.0.0"
  codename: Project Muad'Dib

  definition: |
    The reference implementation of the ContextCore standard—a suite of
    integrated development and observability tools built for the
    Language Model 1.0 era.

  producer: Force Multiplier Labs

  name_origin:
    inspiration: "Muad'Dib (desert mouse) from Frank Herbert's Dune"
    meaning: |
      A small creature that survives in hostile terrain and "points the way."
      Represents guidance through complexity with humility.
    reflects:
      - Guiding users through fragmented tooling
      - Humble but essential (metadata enables everything)
      - Wisdom without overclaiming
    acknowledgment: |
      We acknowledge valid criticism of Dune's colonial and orientalist overtones.
      We adopt only the narrow metaphor: a small creature that survives through
      wisdom rather than power, that points the way rather than conquers.
    note: "No Sapho juice was consumed in the creation of most of this project."
