term:
  id: business_observability
  name: Business Observability
  type: paradigm
  version: "1.0.0"

  definition: |
    The practice of grounding observability in business context—connecting
    technical telemetry to business meaning, ownership, and impact.

  key_insight: |
    Observability frameworks like OpenTelemetry provide plumbing (traces,
    metrics, logs) but not the business context needed to make that
    plumbing useful. Business Observability bridges this gap.

  enables:
    - Stakeholders find "their" parts in dashboards
    - Operators understand systems they didn't build
    - Observability artifacts generated from business context
    - Authoritative onboarding for humans and agents

  contrasts_with:
    - Ad-hoc dashboards disconnected from business meaning
    - Technical metrics without stakeholder mapping
    - Observability requiring construction knowledge
