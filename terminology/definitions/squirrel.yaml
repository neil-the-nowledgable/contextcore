  definition: |
    Token-efficient skills library. Provides progressive disclosure—agents
    load only what they need, when they need it. Like a squirrel storing
    nuts for later retrieval.

  purpose: Skills library for token-efficient agent discovery

  capabilities:
    - Progressive disclosure (MANIFEST → index → full schema)
    - Token-budgeted skill definitions
    - Keyword routing tables
    - Capability discovery via TraceQL
    - Dev Tour Guide for onboarding

  why_squirrel: |
    Squirrels are efficient gatherers—storing exactly what they need
    and retrieving it quickly. This package stores skill knowledge
    efficiently and retrieves only what's needed.

  patterns:
    - MANIFEST.yaml as entry point
    - _index.yaml for routing
    - capabilities/*.yaml for full schemas
    - Token budget annotations on every file

  triggers:
    - squirrel
    - skills
    - ajidamoo
    - progressive_disclosure
    - token_efficient

  depends_on:
    - spider

  persistence:
    tempo_query: '{ term.id = "squirrel" }'
